    <h2>More about this website</h2>
        <p>As part of my CodeNation course, part of what has been assigned to me as additional work is to create a website using HTML and CSS. This website is the result - it has been designed to be a future hub for information about me and a reference point for my projects. The version of this website that you are reading right now will be the first and only revision for a while - I don't have much more to write about for the time being, so I don't want the website to be filler. Hoepfully, in the future, this will change, and a second revision will be made.</p>

    <h2>Why does the site look like this?</h2>
        <p>I have spent a considerable amount of time developing the CSS of this website so that it would look better than the typical basic HTML website with no styling. Most of this time was spent designing the graphical elements of this site. While this may mean that the resulting "Web 1.0" style page is more static in practice, I believe it sets itself apart from newer sites, which may be more scaleable but have a simplistic design which I think lacks originality.</p>
        <h3>Some weaknesses in the current design:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficult to scale - requires substantial editing.</li>
            <li>Not very modular - modularity would best be achieved through flask, but this would require rewriting from the ground up, which is not worth the effort.</li>
            <li>Not suited to mobile interfaces.</li>
            <li>Designed with and for a 1280x1024 resolution - there will be visual glitches in widescreen resolutions but there is currently no way for me to test it (not having a suitable screen).</li>
            <li>The page banner is only wide enought for a 4:3 resolution, but increasing the image size would mean recreating some graphics from scratch, and a widescreen banner causes visual problems on non-widescreen monitors, such as mine.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Issues with other website design:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Whilst optimized for a mobile screen, many desktop sites feel clumsy and inefficient in the use of space.</li>
            <li>Not optimized for smaller desktop resolutions.</li>
            <li>Modularity and scalability is a positive but this can end up in many websites looking bland and identical to others - whether this is due to a deliberate design or lack or design, I am unsure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> My end goal, with future website revision, would be to find a good balance between these two examples, with a more scalable or modular design, that still retains some visual creativity.</p>
